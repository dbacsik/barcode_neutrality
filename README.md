# barcode_neutrality
Assess barcode frequency over several passages.
Experimental notebook is here: [https://benchling.com/s/etr-NabxP7eQFzARrExqODzX](https://benchling.com/s/etr-NabxP7eQFzARrExqODzX)

I rescued CA09 viruses (WT, bcHA, bcNA, and bcHA/bcNA) carrying 20 barcodes on the HA and NA segments. I passaged these in duplicate 3X in MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells at an MOI of 0.04. I titered between passages, and the while the titers were variable between replicates, they did not show any consistent trends, indicating that no sample acquired a tissue-culture adaptation mutation.

In this computational notebook, I will parse the barcodes and assess their frequency from plasmid -> rescue -> passaging. I expect barcodes not to have a fitness effect, and for their proportion to stay consistent throughout the experiment.
